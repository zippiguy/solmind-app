// SolMind MVP0 server-only /admin access request composition helper.
//
// Purpose:
//   - own the per-request composition that the /admin/access Route Handler used to
//     inline: build the request-auth principal source (WHO) and the real Admin auth
//     source (WHAT), delegate the decision to resolveAdminRouteAccess, and reduce the
//     outcome to a single opaque { allowed } shape;
//   - make that composition deterministically testable WITHOUT Next.js request APIs
//     or real env, by accepting an injected RequestCookieAccessor and injectable
//     principal-source / auth-source / audit-writer factories. The route stays a thin
//     shell that only reads cookies() and serializes the result.
//
// Architecture notes (MVP0):
//   - Server-only and OFF the shared src/lib/solmind/auth/index.ts barrel
//     (AUTH-RLS-DEC-007, AUTH-RLS-DEC-013), mirroring composeRequestAuthContext,
//     adminRouteAccess, serviceRoleClient, and requestAuthClient. Import it only from
//     the explicit /admin server composition path. The `import "server-only";`
//     marker below is the import-time guard, backed by the runtime browser guard
//     (AUTH-RLS-DEC-023, AUTH-RLS-DEF-001).
//   - Identity (WHO) and record loading (WHAT) stay structurally separate
//     (AUTH-RLS-DEC-015): the principal source proves identity; the Admin auth source
//     loads records. A null principal denies before any service-role read (enforced
//     by resolveAdminRouteAccess -> composeRequestAuthContext).
//   - Fail closed (AUTH-RLS-DEC-016): any construction or configuration error (for
//     example missing public or service-role env) is swallowed and denies, so no
//     cookie, token, record, or secret can escape through an error path. This is the
//     same posture the route enforced inline; keeping it here makes it testable and
//     keeps it as defense in depth alongside the route's own outer guard.
//   - Opaque outcome only. The return value is exactly { allowed: boolean }. The
//     reason, the derived context, the active role, and any profile/session/identity
//     detail from resolveAdminRouteAccess are intentionally dropped here, so the
//     outward /admin/access surface can never leak them and no Explorer-private or
//     Guide-private field is assembled into the response.
//
// Runtime audit persistence (AUD-3; Doc 22 Sections 10-11; AUTH-RLS-DEC-028/029/030):
//   - This boundary is the single place the bounded authRlsAuditEvent model is
//     constructed, and as of AUD-3 it PERSISTS the Family A events through the real
//     AUD-2 result-based writer chain (auditEventWriter.ts over
//     auditEventWriteExecutor.ts over the service-role client), resolved by default
//     from createAdminAuditEventWriter. The default-off / no-op posture is RETIRED
//     for the production /admin/access path; tests inject deterministic writer
//     doubles through the same factory seam.
//   - Per-class write-failure posture (Doc 22 Section 10, approved at Gate 1):
//       * Would-be ALLOW (fail-closed, AUTH-RLS-DEC-029/030): after the boundary
//         resolves the admin actor, the guarded_service_role_read row is persisted
//         FIRST, then the admin_route_access_decision / allow row, and BOTH must
//         succeed before the outward { allowed: true }. A guarded-read write failure
//         denies with no allow row written; an allow-decision write failure after
//         the guarded-read row persisted denies, and the truthful residual
//         guarded-read row is accepted for MVP0 (AUTH-RLS-DEC-030 carve-out). An
//         audit-write-failure-induced deny persists NO additional decision or
//         failure row (not approved; the bounded operational signal below is the
//         only side channel).
//       * DENY decision and AUTH-RESOLUTION FAILURE (best-effort): the outcome is
//         already a deny and never changes; a persist failure raises only the
//         bounded, value-free operational signal.
//   - The persisted guarded-read event is constructed POST-RESOLUTION with the
//     server-derived admin account id (AUTH-RLS-DEC-029). The legacy pre-read
//     guarded-read bridge is REMOVED: this module no longer passes onServiceRoleRead,
//     so the pre-read hook stays a value-free, default-off marker inside
//     composeRequestAuthContext (placement unchanged, AUTH-RLS-DEC-024) and no
//     double emission is possible. Deny outcomes persist no guarded-read row for
//     MVP0 (AUTH-RLS-DEF-019 tracks the deferred vocabulary expansion).
//   - No false attribution and no false failure rows: the writer is result-based and
//     NEVER throws, so an audit-write failure can never route through the generic
//     fail-closed catch below and mint a false auth_resolution_failure row. The
//     auth_resolution_failure event is persisted (best-effort) only for genuine
//     resolution exceptions: the bridged onAuthResolutionFailure seam inside
//     composeRequestAuthContext, and this module's own catch for a request-path
//     construction/factory exception.
//   - Operational signal: onAuditWriteFailure is a bounded, VALUE-FREE injectable
//     seam (no arguments, no payload, default no-op) fired once per failed persist
//     attempt. A real operational logging/alarm mechanism is deferred to its own
//     approved slice; the signal itself is guarded so a throwing implementation can
//     never flip an outcome, leak, or reach the fail-closed catch.
